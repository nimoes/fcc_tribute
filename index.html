  I am embarrassed to say that I never listened to Louis Armstrong until my sophomore year, when my college roommate played <i>La vie en rose</i> during our study in Jamestown Hall. I am not a huge music person, and furthermore, I am definitely not a big jazz person either. To my shallow understanding, jazz involves several clashing of several instruments or sounds, and because of its complex, dynamic nature, I always shied away from it and listened to something more...predictable and tunes that I could follow along. But something about Armstrong's <i>La vie en rose</i> (which means "Life in Rosy Hues") was different. Rather, it was a good introduction for someone like me to listen to, and start giving more appreciation towards jazz.

  <i>La vie en rose</i> was one of Armstrong's hit music in 1950s. It was orginially written by a French singer, Edith Piaf, in 1945. Although many of his songs were not originally his, adroit musical talents allowed him to tune and tweak each melody and call it his own.
